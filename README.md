# FirmLLM - A Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System for Large-scale Firmware Collection and Analysis

FirmLLM is an integrated system that combines firmware collection and analysis functions, leveraging large language models (LLM) for intelligent firmware analysis. The system consists of two core modules: the firmware collection system (FirmCrawler) and the firmware analysis system (FirmAnalyzer). Both systems adopt a multi-agent collaborative approach based on user-defined prompts, enabling autonomous exploration and analysis, and can solve long-cycle complex tasks.

## System Components

### 1. Firmware Collection System (FirmCrawler)

`firmcrawler` is used for automated collection of firmware files from various manufacturers. The system is built upon and optimized from [WebVoyager](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/web-navigation/web_voyager/) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13919), implementing a multi-agent collaboration system for large-scale firmware collection. WebVoyager is an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end-to-end by interacting with real-world websites.
