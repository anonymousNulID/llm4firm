# FirmLLM

A Multi-Agent System for Large-Scale Firmware Collection and Analysis Based on Large Language Models

FirmLLM is designed to **automate long-cycle analysis tasks** by leveraging multi-agent collaboration and LLMs, enabling scalable and intelligent firmware collection and vulnerability analysis.


---

## Overview

**FirmLLM** is an integrated system for large-scale firmware acquisition and security analysis. It leverages multi-agent collaboration and large language models (LLMs) to achieve intelligent automation in both crawling and analysis.

The system consists of two main modules:

- **FirmCrawler**: A multi-agent web crawler for automated firmware collection  
- **FirmAnalyzer**: A firmware security analysis engine that combines static tools and LLM capabilities

## üï∏Ô∏è Firmware Collection System (FirmCrawler)

**FirmCrawler** is used for automated collection of firmware files from various manufacturers. The system is built upon and optimized from [WebVoyager](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/web-navigation/web_voyager/) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13919), implementing a multi-agent collaboration system for large-scale firmware collection. WebVoyager is an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end-to-end by interacting with real-world websites.

## üîç Firmware Analysis System (FirmAnalyzer)

**FirmAnalyzer** provides comprehensive firmware security analysis capabilities.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Capabilities

- Firmware unpacking and filesystem detection  
- Static and semantic vulnerability detection  
- Binary disassembly and logic analysis  
- CVE correlation and risk scoring  
- Human-readable reports powered by LLMs

### üìÑ Core Files

- `run.py`: Entry point for analysis  
- `explore.py`: Filesystem exploration and metadata gathering  
- `analyze.py`: Firmware file analysis module  
  - **Sensitive Info Pattern Matching**: Regex and semantic pattern detection (preliminary filtering to guide LLM inspection and direction)  
  - **Shell Command Executor**: Executes Linux tools such as `cat`, `grep`, etc.  
  - **CVE Query Tool**: Queries vulnerability data through APIs  
  - **Disassembly Assistant**: Integrates `radare2` with LLM for binary reasoning  
- `requirements.yaml`: A user-configurable file that defines the overall analysis plan. It allows users to customize:
  - The **scope of analysis** and specific **target components**  
  - **Directory scanning priorities** (e.g., focus on `/etc`, `/bin`, or `/www`)  
  - **Security analysis strategies**, such as whether to perform code-level audits or pattern-based detections  
  - **Risk severity classification rules** to define what constitutes high/medium/low severity  
  - The **format and structure** of generated **reports and summaries**
  
### üîå Data Sources

- [FirmSec Dataset](https://github.com/NESA-Lab/FirmSecDataset)

---

## üìä Example Outputs (Examples)

Contains complete logs and reports from analyzing firmware using **DeepSeek-v3** and **DeepSeek-r1** models.

### üìù Files

- `explore.log`: Full exploration log  
- `report.txt`: File-by-file security analysis  
- `summary.txt`: Overall security summary and risk level

### üß™ Firmware Examples

- OpenWrt  
- D-Link  
- MikroTik RouterOS  
- Ubiquiti  

### ü§ñ Model Performance Notes

We primarily use **DeepSeek-v3** and **DeepSeek-r1** for firmware analysis.  
However, our experiments have shown that **Claude-Sonnet** demonstrates promising performance in code auditing tasks, especially for semantic reasoning and cross-file logic analysis.

DeepSeek offers lower costs, but we are actively experimenting and comparing results across multiple models to find the optimal configuration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Challenges

### Format & Semantic Limitations

- Inability to automatically decrypt or handle proprietary firmware formats  
- LLMs may hallucinate when analyzing complex control flows  
- Limited understanding of intricate build scripts and service configurations

### Experimental Verification Bottlenecks

- Lack of standardized firmware security benchmarks  
- Inconsistent vulnerability reporting ground truth  
- Physical device validation may take 3‚Äì5 days per firmware

### Technical Constraints

- LLM API rate limits reduce processing parallelism  
- CVE data synchronization delays due to NVD refresh cycles  
- No modeling of low-level hardware interactions

---

## üöß Roadmap

Upcoming work will focus on:

- **Integrating more static analysis tools**, especially for binary-focused workflows to improve analysis coverage and accuracy  
- **Combining symbolic execution with LLMs** to enhance deep vulnerability discovery and validation  
- **Exploring firmware runtime state analysis** (e.g., process behavior, service call graphs, and system responses) to prioritize high-risk issues

---

## üìå Notes & Compliance

1. All results are for **research purposes only**  
2. Please ensure legal and ethical use of the system  
3. Verification should be performed in sandboxed/test environments  
4. We are actively engaging with vendors to confirm findings and, under compliant conditions, release more security reports
