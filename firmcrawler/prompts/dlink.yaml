    Note that you start from the top of the page, so no need to scroll up. Make sure to reach the bottom before submitting ANSWER.
    Begin scrolling down to load all content. Process each viewport systematically.

    Example workflow:
    {{
        "thought": "Starting from page top, scanning for firmware download sections",
        "action": "GET_NAVIGATION_LINKS 1,2,3",
        "status": "continue",
        "next_step": "After collecting current info, scroll down for more content"
    }}

    {{
        "thought": "Firmware info from current viewport collected, continuing down",
        "action": "SCROLL WINDOW; down",
        "status": "continue",
        "next_step": "Process newly visible firmware info"
    }}

    {{
        "thought": "Reached page bottom, all firmware info collected",
        "action": "ANSWER {collected_firmware_info}",
        "status": "complete",
        "next_step": "Task complete, all firmware info gathered"
    }}
