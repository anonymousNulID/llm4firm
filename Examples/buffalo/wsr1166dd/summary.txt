[Main Issues]
- Critical Issues:
  - /etc/shadow: Root account has no password set (empty password field), confirmed by /etc/profile script warning, allowing unrestricted access and potential full system compromise.
  - /etc/key-build.pub: Private key exposure ("private key 605c7f1ccfcc1f58") in a public file, risking unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.
  - /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf: References to private keys (cakey.pem, tsakey.pem) and placeholder passwords ('secret') expose sensitive cryptographic material. Weak hash algorithms (md5, sha1) are specified as acceptable message digests, increasing risks of collision attacks.
  - /etc/config/uhttpd: Explicit reference to private key file (/etc/uhttpd.key). If improperly secured, it could allow decryption of HTTPS traffic or server impersonation.
  - /bin/busybox: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-5747, CVE-2021-28831, CVE-2018-20679, CVE-2017-16544, CVE-2017-15874, CVE-2017-15873, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2022-30065, CVE-2021-42381, CVE-2023-42366, CVE-2023-42365, CVE-2023-42364, CVE-2023-42363) including heap-buffer-overflow, use-after-free, integer underflow/overflow, remote code execution, and denial of service risks.
  - /etc/config/dropbear: 'PasswordAuth', 'RootPasswordAuth', and 'RootLogin' enabled by default, increasing brute force attack risks. Multiple CVEs identified (e.g., CVE-2023-48795, CVE-2021-36369, CVE-2020-36254, CVE-2019-12953, CVE-2018-15599) affecting Dropbear, with CVE-2023-48795 rated critical for integrity check bypass.
  - /sbin/init: Use of insecure function sprintf without input validation or bounds checking at address 0x4015c8, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution.
  - /sbin/netifd: Format string vulnerabilities identified in printf (0x402974) and fprintf calls within sym._fini (0x4115a4).
  - /sbin/procd: Absence of input validation or sanitization in the function chain leading to insecure functions like 'gets' and 'sscanf'.
  - /sbin/fw3: Remote code execution vulnerability in `sym._init` due to insecure use of `gets` and dynamic code execution via `jalr t9`.
  - /sbin/logread: OS Command Injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-29778) in logread component.
  - /sbin/sysupgrade: '--restore-backup' option allows restoring configuration from a URL without proper validation, enabling arbitrary code execution if a malicious URL is provided.
  - /sbin/wifi: Multiple critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-53940, CVE-2024-53939, CVE-2024-53937, CVE-2017-8772, CVE-2024-53938) including command injection, default credentials, and unauthenticated TELNET access.
  - /lib/libc.so: Vulnerable to CVE-2019-14697, allowing out-of-bounds writes due to x87 floating-point stack adjustment imbalance. memcpy operation in sym.__init_ssp lacks input validation, and use of 'gets' in sym.bind_textdomain_codeset introduces buffer overflow risks.
  - /etc/services: Insecure service configurations detected, including telnet (23/tcp), ftp (21/tcp), and finger (79/tcp), transmitting data in plaintext and exposing the system to interception and misuse.
  - /etc/config/etherwake: Plaintext password (AABBCCDDEEFF) used for wake-on-LAN functionality, exposing sensitive credentials.
  - /etc/config/pptpd: Plaintext credentials ('youruser'/'yourpass') and PPTP server IP configurations (local: 192.168.0.1, remote range: 192.168.0.20-30) exposed, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - /etc/config/snmpd: Default SNMP community strings "public" (read-only) and "private" (read-write) configured, exposing the system to unauthorized access and manipulation. Presence of outdated SNMP versions v1 and v2c increases risks of data interception and exploitation (CVE-2005-3722).
  - /etc/init.d/boot: Hardcoded PSK (Pre-Shared Key) value 'FacWPAPSK1_BK=12345' exposes wireless network credentials, allowing unauthorized access if extracted.
  - /etc/init.d/embeddd: Sensitive DDNS credentials (username, password, update_url) defined in plaintext within the script, risking exposure of authentication data.
  - /etc/init.d/openvpn: Sensitive certificate and key data (ca_inline, cert_inline, key_inline, tls_inline) written in plaintext to `/var/run/ovpn.config`, and plaintext username/password written to `/var/run/ovpn_auth.txt` when user_pass_auth is enabled, risking exposure of cryptographic material and authentication data. Management interface bound to 127.0.0.1:14 without clear access restrictions, potentially allowing unauthorized control.
  - /etc/init.d/pptpd: Plaintext password written to $CHAP_SECRETS file without encryption, exposing login credentials. Firewall rule allows unrestricted TCP access on port 1723, increasing exposure risks.
  - /etc/ppp/options: Logging disabled by setting logfile to /dev/null, removing audit trails. Additionally, maxfail 0 permits unlimited failed connection attempts, increasing brute-force risks.
  - /etc/openvpn/server.conf: Management interface bound to 127.0.0.1:14 without additional authentication mechanisms, posing a risk if improperly exposed externally.
  - /lib/functions/uci-defaults.sh: Potential sensitive data exposure identified through patterns resembling password handling (e.g., 'local key="$2"', 'json_add_boolean "$key"'). If these handle credentials without proper security measures, it could lead to sensitive data exposure.

- Major Issues:
  - /etc/sysctl.conf: Disabled bridge firewalling (net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-* set to 0) and enabled IP forwarding for IPv4 and IPv6 (net.ipv4.ip_forward=1, net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1), increasing attack surface and potential exposure to network attacks.
  - /lib/libuci.so: Affected by CVE-2020-28951, introducing use-after-free risks when handling malicious package names, potentially leading to memory corruption or privilege escalation.
  - /lib/libubox.so: Affected by CVE-2020-7248, a stack-based buffer overflow in JSON serialization functionality, potentially allowing remote code execution.
  - /sbin/kmodloader: Stack-based buffer overflow in __dn_expand function (CVE-2014-3484), affecting musl libc versions before 1.1.2 and versions 0.9.13 through 1.0.3.
  - /lib/uboot-envtools.sh: Lack of input validation before writing configurations to /etc/fw_env.config, potentially allowing malicious configuration injection.
  - /bin/ipcalc.sh: Lack of input validation and sanitization in ARGV handling within functions like ip2int(), int2ip(), and compl32().
  - /etc/hotplug.json: Creation of device nodes with broad permissions (e.g., '0666') and insecure use of 'exec' to call external scripts like '/sbin/hotplug-call', risking unauthorized access and script execution.
  - /etc/config/ddns: Explicit fields for username ("your_username") and password ("your_password") placeholders, which could expose credentials if replaced with actual values.
  - /etc/config/rpcd: Plaintext username ('webuser') and password ('$p$webuser') stored in an insecure format, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - /etc/init.d/snmpd: Dynamic construction of SNMP configuration file (/var/run/snmpd.conf) using user-provided values (e.g., community strings, source IPs) without secure defaults or validation, risking unauthorized access.
  - /www/index.html: Version information exposure ('1.1.0+b3321bb2') in the meta tag could allow attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities associated with this specific version.

- Other Issues:
  - /etc/preinit: Version information exposure ('2006-2016') could indicate outdated software components with potential unpatched vulnerabilities.
  - /etc/rc.common: Version information exposure ('2006-2012') and insecure handling of service control variables ($START, $STOP) without proper validation, risking unintended service behavior or exposure.
  - /bin/busybox: Exposure of sensitive content such as '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow' strings.
  - /bin/config_generate: Default credentials ('username'/'password') embedded in plaintext for PPPoE configuration.
  - /bin/uclient-fetch: Presence of '--password=<password>' string indicates potential insecure handling or exposure of credentials.
  - /lib/functions.sh: Code injection risk in append function due to unsanitized use of 'eval' with user-controlled variables $var and $value. Exposure of version information ("Copyright (C) 2006-2014 OpenWrt.org") could help attackers identify outdated software.
