- [Location] bin/opkg
- [Type] Component
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Critical security issues identified in sym.remove_maintainer_scripts and sym.pkg_dest_init functions.
- [Details] Lack of input validation and use of insecure functions like sym_sprintf_alloc lead to format string vulnerabilities and arbitrary code execution risks. sym.pkg_dest_init handles configuration files without sanitization.
- [Impact] Arbitrary code execution and memory corruption risks.
- [Risk Level] Critical

- [Location] bin/uclient-fetch
- [Type] Component/Credential
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Sensitive content and critical vulnerabilities detected.
- [Details] Embedded HTTP authentication password parameter (--password=<password>) poses credential exposure risk. Function pointer execution without validation (sym.imp.getenv) and unvalidated parameters passed to memcpy via sym.imp.uclient_set_proxy_url could lead to memory corruption or remote code execution.
- [Impact] Potential credential exposure and remote code execution/memory corruption.
- [Risk Level] Critical

- [Location] bin/config_generate
- [Type] Configuration/Credential
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Hardcoded default credentials and insecure configurations.
- [Details] Default password 'password' embedded. Default IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), subnet masks, NTP servers ('0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org'), and hostname ('OpenWrt') are hardcoded. PPPoE network configurations include default username 'username' and password 'password'.
- [Impact] Unauthorized access due to easily guessable credentials and potential fingerprinting of the system.
- [Risk Level] High
