[Main Issues]
- Critical Issues: 
  - /bin/busybox: Multiple critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-48174, CVE-2022-30065, CVE-2022-28391) including stack buffer overflow, use-after-free, and arbitrary code execution. Lacks ASLR/PIE protection, has writable GOT, and contains direct '/bin/sh' string without validation.
  - /sbin/netifd: Critical stack-based buffer overflow in entry0 function due to use of vulnerable 'gets' function. Lacks stack canary protection, has executable stack (NX-bit disabled), and no PIC, enabling shellcode execution and control flow hijacking.
  - /sbin/ubusd: Critical vulnerabilities including register-controlled execution flow enabling ROP chain construction via stack buffer overflow, RWX memory segment allowing self-modifying code and runtime unpacking. No stack canary, ASLR, or W^X protections detected.
  - /lib/libfstools.so: Two critical command injection vulnerabilities in sym.jffs2_switch and sym.fopivot functions via uncontrolled format strings and unvalidated user input in system() calls, enabling full root command execution.
  - /etc/shadow: Empty root password hash (::) detected, allowing unrestricted root access to the system.
  - /etc/config/dropbear: Insecure SSH configuration with password authentication enabled for both regular users and root ('PasswordAuth' and 'RootPasswordAuth' set to 'on'), exposing the system to brute-force attacks. Default SSH port 22 in use.
  - /usr/sbin/dnsmasq: Multiple critical vulnerabilities in version 2.80 (CVE-2020-25687, CVE-2020-25683, CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2020-25681, CVE-2020-25684, CVE-2020-25685, CVE-2020-25686, CVE-2017-14491, CVE-2017-14492, CVE-2017-14493) including heap-based buffer overflows, DNS cache poisoning, and remote code execution.
  - /usr/sbin/dropbear: Critical vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-48795 (Terrapin attack) and CVE-2017-9078 (post-authentication root RCE), exposing SSH server to integrity bypass and remote code execution.
  - /usr/sbin/wpad: Critical stack-based buffer overflow in function fcn.00418020 due to unvalidated HTTP request input, enabling remote code execution. Multiple CVEs affecting hostapd/wpa_supplicant v2.7 (CVE-2019-9499, CVE-2019-9498, CVE-2019-9497, CVE-2019-9496, CVE-2019-9495, CVE-2019-9494) including authentication bypass and side-channel attacks. Vulnerable SAE/EAP-PWD configurations detected.
  - /usr/sbin/pppd: Critical insecure debug logging configuration with 'show-password' enabled, exposing credentials in debug logs. Sensitive content (password=, user=) detected without proper protection, and 'hide-password' disabled by default, increasing credential exposure risk.
  - /usr/lib/libxtables.so.12.2.0: Critical vulnerabilities in sym.xtables_numeric_to_ip6addr (missing stack protections, buffer overflow) and fcn.000026a0 (fixed-size buffer with unbounded input), enabling unauthenticated RCE and privilege escalation.
  - /usr/lib/dnsmasq/dhcp-script.sh: Critical arbitrary code execution vulnerability via uncontrolled sourcing of external script through $USER_DHCPSCRIPT environment variable, enabling privilege escalation if the variable is attacker-controlled.
  - /lib/network/config.sh: Critical insecure handling of network interface configuration and ubus calls. The 'ubus_call' function does not validate or sanitize its inputs, which could lead to injection attacks if the input is controlled by an attacker.
  - /lib/wifi/mac80211.sh: Critical insecure default wireless configuration with default SSID 'OpenWrt' and no encryption (encryption=none), exposing the network to unauthorized access and potential attacks.
  - /etc/rc.button/failsafe: Critical insecure file handling, writing environment variable ${BUTTON} to /tmp/failsafe_button without validation or sanitization, potentially leading to file manipulation or injection attacks.
  - /etc/rc.button/reset: Critical insecure command execution, executing `reboot` and `jffs2reset -y` without proper input validation, potentially leading to unintended system resets or factory resets.
  - /etc/rc.button/wps: Critical insecure handling of WPS credentials and potential command injection risk. The script processes WPS credentials using `ubus` calls without proper validation or sanitization, dynamically constructing JSON payloads with user-supplied input (`ssid`, `key`, `encryption`), which could be exploited for command injection or JSON injection.

- Major Issues:
  - /bin/config_generate: Multiple instances of hardcoded credentials in network configuration (username='username', password='password') for PPPoE and general network settings, exposing sensitive authentication data.
  - /bin/uclient-fetch: Hardcoded credentials detected with string 'password=<password>'
  - /lib/functions.sh: Insecure file handling and command injection risk in user_add and group_add functions due to direct manipulation of /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group without proper input validation or sanitization.
  - /lib/libc.so: CVE-2019-14697 vulnerability in musl libc version 1.1.23 (x87 floating-point stack adjustment imbalance) and potential sensitive credential exposure with hashed string '$1$abcd0123$9Qcg8DyviekV3tDGMZynJ1'.
  - /etc/banner: Firmware version information exposure ('OpenWrt SNAPSHOT, r10956-62dbe361a1') enabling targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities.
  - /etc/config/dhcp: Internal network configuration exposure including DNS settings, DHCP lease file paths, and interface bindings, potentially revealing network structure and attack vectors.
  - /usr/lib/libjson-c.so.4.0.0: Potential version exposure detected, with version-related strings like 'json_c_version' and 'json_c_version_num', but no explicit version number found. Medium-severity issue as it could aid attackers in identifying vulnerabilities.
  - /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.7/rp-pppoe.so: Version information exposure through strings 'RP-PPPoE plugin version %s compiled against pppd %s', potentially aiding attackers in identifying vulnerabilities.
  - /etc/rc.button/rfkill: Major insecure configuration handling in wireless settings, modifying wireless configuration using 'uci set' and 'uci commit' without explicit validation or sanitization of input, potentially leading to insecure configurations.

- Other Issues:
  - /bin/busybox: Potential improper handling of sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow)
  - /sbin/procd: Embedded version string 'r1gGa' detected, potentially exposing version information to attackers
  - /etc/device_info: Device information exposure (manufacturer, product, revision) could aid reconnaissance efforts
  - /usr/sbin/iw: Version information exposure through version-related strings in executable
