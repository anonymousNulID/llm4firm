Firmware Summary:
[Basic Info]
- Name/Version: Ubiquiti 4.3.22.11330
- Device/Type/Arch: Ubiquiti device, ARM architecture
- Key Info: Linux kernel version 3.6.5, released on 2020-11-03

[Coverage] 
- Key Dirs: /usr/etc, /usr/www, /lib, /bin, /etc, /etc/rc.d, /etc/udhcpc
- Key Files: /usr/etc/activate_tunnel.sh, /usr/etc/common.sh, /usr/etc/default_ar9344.cfg, /usr/etc/passwd, /etc/default_bcm5334x.cfg, /etc/default_nossid.cfg, /etc/.version, /etc/hotplug2.rules, /etc/profile, /etc/protocols, /etc/services, /etc/default-ec20.cfg, /etc/default_nossid_qca956x.cfg, /etc/system.cfg, /etc/syswrapper.sh, /etc/ethertypes, /etc/rc.d/rc, /etc/rc.d/rc.btusb, /etc/rc.d/rc.identity, /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc, /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc_ip_only

[Main Issues]
- Critical Issues:
  - /etc/system.cfg: Exposure of plaintext password for the user 'ubnt' (users.1.password=VvpvCwhccFv6Q), risking unauthorized access.
  - /etc/syswrapper.sh: Use of `eval` with unsanitized inputs in functions like `check_vap_status` and `run`, allowing command injection vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution or privilege escalation.
  - /etc/syswrapper.sh: Predictable lockfile paths (/var/run/fwupdate.pid, /var/run/led.lock) and insecure handling of sensitive keys/tokens (e.g., /var/run/stream.token) create risks of symlink attacks and unauthorized access.
  - /usr/etc/activate_tunnel.sh: Lack of input sanitization for variables like $dev and $remote used in critical commands (`ip link`, `ip l2tp`), potentially allowing command injection vulnerabilities.
  - /etc/hotplug2.rules: Improper device handling with insecure permissions (e.g., /dev/%DEVICENAME% with mode 0666), enabling unauthorized access to critical device files.
  - /etc/rc.d/rc.identity: Insecure handling of SSH keys and web server certificates, including lack of enforced strong permissions or integrity checks, potentially exposing private keys and sensitive cryptographic material.
  - /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc, /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc_ip_only: Multiple CVEs detected (CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-2147, CVE-2011-2716), exposing risks such as heap-based buffer overflow, integer overflow, and command injection via DHCP options, leading to remote code execution or denial of service.

- Major Issues:
  - /etc/syswrapper.sh: Exposure of versioning details through variables like FW_MD5SUMFILE and /var/run/fwversion.next, increasing the risk of targeted attacks based on known vulnerabilities.
  - /usr/etc/common.sh, /etc/.version, /etc/profile, /etc/protocols, /etc/default-ec20.cfg: Exposure of version information via `/lib/version`, `/etc/.version`, `/etc/profile`, `/etc/protocols`, and `mgmt.flavor=ace`, enabling attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities associated with this firmware version.
  - /etc/default_nossid.cfg, /etc/default_qca956x.cfg, /etc/default-ec20.cfg, /etc/default_nossid_qca956x.cfg: Default settings (mgmt.is_default=true), bridged network configurations (bridge.1.devname=br0), and unencrypted wireless networks (wireless.1.security=none) increase attack surface by exposing internal devices and relying on insecure defaults.
  - /etc/services: Presence of outdated or insecure protocols (e.g., Kerberos v4) and references to specific service versions (e.g., Kerberos v5) exposing the system to known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2018-5710, CVE-2018-5709, and CVE-2012-1015.
  - /etc/rc.d/rc.btusb: Insecure handling of Bluetooth MAC address (bdaddr) from '/proc/ubnthal/system.info' without source validation, risking Bluetooth device impersonation or misconfiguration.
  - /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc, /etc/udhcpc/udhcpc_ip_only: Use of `eval` with unsanitized input from configuration files ('/tmp/system.cfg', '/tmp/running.cfg'), creating a command injection vulnerability that could allow arbitrary command execution.

- Other Issues:
  - /etc/ethertypes: Exposure of IP version information (IPv4, IPv6), which could assist attackers in identifying protocol-specific vulnerabilities.
  - /etc/default_nossid_qca956x.cfg: Presence of specific IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.20, 192.168.1.1) indicating sensitive network configurations and potential internal infrastructure exposure.
  - /etc/rc.d/rc: Potential SSH key setup detected with improper configuration risks due to sourcing 'rc.identity', which may expose sensitive data if not securely handled.
