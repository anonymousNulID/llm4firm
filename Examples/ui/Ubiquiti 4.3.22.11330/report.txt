- [Location] etc/activate_tunnel.sh
- [Type] Component
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Script lacks input validation and sanitization for critical commands.
- [Details] The script dynamically retrieves network parameters and uses variables like $cfg, $cmd, $dev, and $remote without proper sanitization in commands such as `ip link` and `ip l2tp`, which could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

'''
'''
- [Location] etc/rc.d/rc
- [Type] Configuration
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Potential SSH key and certificate setup issue detected.
- [Details] The script references 'rc.identity' for setting up certificates and SSH keys. It dynamically generates SSH keys if they are not present and creates symbolic links for web server certificates ('server.crt', 'server.key'). However, it does not enforce strong permissions or verify the integrity of these files.
- [Impact] Improper handling could lead to unauthorized access due to weak file permissions or exposure of sensitive cryptographic material.
- [Risk Level] Medium

- [Location] etc/rc.d/rc.btusb
- [Type] Configuration
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Potential insecure handling of Bluetooth MAC address (bdaddr).
- [Details] The script retrieves and processes a Bluetooth MAC address from '/proc/ubnthal/system.info' without validating its source or integrity.
- [Impact] If an attacker manipulates this value, it could lead to unauthorized Bluetooth device impersonation or misconfiguration.
- [Risk Level] Medium

- [Location] etc/rc.d/rc.identity
- [Type] Credential
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Potential exposure of sensitive cryptographic material.
- [Details] The script handles SSH keys (RSA and DSS) and web server certificates. It checks for pre-existing keys but generates new ones using dropbearkey if none are found. Permissions or storage locations are not explicitly secured.
- [Impact] This could lead to unintended exposure of private keys if permissions or storage locations are improperly secured.
- [Risk Level] High

'''
- [Location] etc/udhcpc/udhcpc
- [Type] Component
- [Version Info] BusyBox udhcpc version 1.20, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-2147
- [Description] The identified version of udhcpc is vulnerable to two critical vulnerabilities: CVE-2016-2148 (Heap-based buffer overflow) and CVE-2016-2147 (Integer overflow).
- [Details] Both vulnerabilities affect versions of BusyBox udhcpc prior to 1.25.0. These issues could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.
- [Impact] Remote code execution or denial of service by exploiting heap-based buffer overflow or integer overflow vulnerabilities.
- [Risk Level] Critical

- [Location] etc/udhcpc/udhcpc_ip_only
- [Type] Component
- [Version Info] BusyBox udhcpc version unknown, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-2147, CVE-2011-2716
- [Description] Multiple vulnerabilities detected in the script including CVE-2016-2148 (Heap-based buffer overflow), CVE-2016-2147 (Integer overflow), and CVE-2011-2716 (Command injection via DHCP options). 
- [Details] The script uses 'eval' to process configuration data dynamically without visible input sanitization. Specifically, the line `eval \`grep dhcpc\. $CFG_FILE | /bin/sed ...` processes data from '/tmp/system.cfg' or '/tmp/running.cfg', making it vulnerable to command injection if an attacker controls these files.
- [Impact] Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or command injection due to improper handling of dynamic input.
- [Risk Level] Critical
