- [Details] The script contains functions that handle file operations and locking mechanisms. The `cl_lock` function uses a directory-based lock mechanism, which could be prone to race conditions or symlink attacks. Additionally, the script reads from configuration files (`/etc/board.info`, `/etc/board.inc`, `/tmp/running.cfg`) without explicit validation of file permissions or ownership.
- [Impact] Potential for information disclosure, tampering, or race condition exploitation
- [Risk Level] Medium

- [Location] lib/wifi/hostapd.sh
- [Type] Configuration
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Insecure cryptographic configuration and weak security policy
- [Details] The script supports outdated and insecure cryptographic protocols such as WPA1 and TKIP, allows mixed modes (WPA1+2), and does not enforce strong encryption by default. It also contains references to cryptographic keys (PSK, secret) and key management configurations, with infrequent key rotation policies (e.g., 'wpa_group_rekey=300' and 'wpa_gmk_rekey=640'). The script retrieves configuration values (e.g., 'psk', 'server', 'port', 'secret', 'nasid') without enforcing secure defaults or proper validation.
- [Impact] Potential exposure of cryptographic keys, weak key management, and compromised security due to outdated protocols and weak authentication algorithms.
- [Risk Level] High

- [Type] Credential
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Potential exposure of sensitive authentication data
- [Details] The script contains references to sensitive authentication data, including 'wpa_passphrase', 'auth_server_shared_secret', and 'auth_server_addr'. The use of 'auth_algs=1' indicates weak authentication algorithms (open system authentication).
- [Impact] Exposure of cryptographic keys or shared secrets if not properly secured, and potential compromise of authentication security.
- [Risk Level] High

- [Type] Version Info/Vulnerability
- [Version Info] RP-PPPoE plugin version and pppd version exposed
- [Description] The file contains version-related strings that could expose version details of the PPPoE plugin and pppd, potentially aiding attackers in identifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, the file contains potential buffer overflow, indirect function invocation, and control flow bypass vulnerabilities.
- [Details] 
  1. Version exposure: Strings 'RP-PPPoE plugin version %s compiled against pppd %s' and 'Invalid PPPoE version (%d)' found.
  2. Buffer overflow vulnerability in `fcn.000018c0` due to use of `sprintf` without bounds checking.
  3. Indirect function invocation in `sym.parsePADOTags` allowing potential manipulation of function pointers.
  4. Control flow bypass in `sym.dumpPacket` due to a jump instruction skipping critical code.
- [Impact] Potential for version-specific attacks, remote code execution, and security bypass through network data manipulation.

- [Location] usr/www/sshd-authkeys.cgi
- [Type] Configuration
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Insecure SSH key management and configuration handling
- [Details] The script uses `cfg_get`, `cfg_set`, and `cfg_del` functions to manage SSH key configurations without explicit validation or access control checks. It also uses a token-based access control mechanism (`$X_ACCESS_TOKEN == $token`) for POST requests, which could be vulnerable to token compromise or bypass. Default values like 'ssh-rsa' are used without proper validation.
- [Impact] Potential unauthorized manipulation of SSH key settings, enabling/disabling keys, or injecting malicious values.
- [Risk Level] High

- [Location] usr/www/fwflash.cgi
- [Type] Configuration
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Hardcoded token-based authentication and lack of input validation
- [Details] The script uses a hardcoded token (`$X_ACCESS_TOKEN == $token`) for authentication, which could be exploited if the token is leaked or guessed. There is no input validation for the `$do_update` variable, which could lead to unauthorized firmware updates.
- [Impact] Potential unauthorized firmware updates or system compromise.
- [Risk Level] High

- [Location] usr/www/ubnt.cgi

- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Token-based authentication mechanism with potential security risks
- [Details] The script uses a token-based authentication check (`if ($REQUEST_METHOD == "POST" && $X_ACCESS_TOKEN == $token)`). The token is compared directly without cryptographic verification, which may expose the system to token replay attacks. Default values like `airsync_port` (64250) are used without proper validation.
- [Impact] Potential unauthorized access or token spoofing, leading to configuration manipulation.
- [Risk Level] Medium
