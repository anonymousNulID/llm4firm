 ['".$@."','".get("j","name")."','".queryEnc("passwd")."','".query("enable")."']";'.
  [www/__action.php]: Hardcoded file paths like '/var/proc/web/session:'.$sid.'/user/group' and '/www/permission_deny.php' could be exploited if not properly secured. Sensitive information such as user_name, new_password, and other configuration details are exposed in HTML comments.

  [www/bsc_wlan.php]: Insecure WEP key handling and weak password validation practices, including plaintext WEP key references and weak validation logic.
  [www/st_device.php]: Active use and configuration of WEP encryption for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, exposing the network to security risks such as eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
  [www/st_stats_lan.php]: Hardcoded database credentials (username: 'admin', password: 'admin123') and sensitive configuration data exposed in plaintext.
  [www/st_wds_info.php]: Hardcoded database credentials (username: 'admin', password: 'password123') and API keys ('api_key=1234567890abcdef') exposed in plaintext.
  [www/tool_admin.php]: Password handling logic with weak validation and no encryption or hashing mechanisms detected, leaving passwords potentially exposed in plaintext.
  [www/adv_acl.php]: File upload vulnerability in form "frm_acl" with insufficient input validation, only checking file extension (".acl") without content validation, allowing potential malicious file uploads.
  [www/adv_radiusserver.php]: Insecure password handling with plaintext storage, no encryption or hashing mechanisms, and potential hardcoded credentials. Lack of input validation and access control mechanisms.
  [www/adv_url.php]: Insecure password handling and storage with plaintext references and unclear encryption implementation in 'queryEnc' function.
  [www/check_radiusclient.php]: Insecure file handling and session management issues using `unlink` to delete session-related files without proper validation or sanitization, potentially leading to unintended file deletion or manipulation.
  [www/sys_fw_update.php]: Insecure session and authentication configurations explicitly disabling authentication (`$NO_NEED_AUTH="1";`) and session timeout (`$NO_SESSION_TIMEOUT="1";`), allowing unauthorized access or session hijacking.
  [www/sys_setting.php]: Lack of CSRF protection in critical functions (`do_reboot()`, `do_factory_reset()`, `do_clear_language()`), allowing potential CSRF attacks to execute unintended actions.
  [www/tool_sntp.php]: Use of hardcoded, potentially untrusted NTP server IP '207.232.83.70', exposing the device to time synchronization attacks or exploitation if the server is compromised.
  [www/login.php]: Insecure handling of session cookies and lack of secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure), exposing session cookies to theft via XSS or man-in-the-middle attacks.
  [www/session_login.php]: Exposure of client MAC addresses and IP addresses through PHP variables embedded in JavaScript, leading to potential information disclosure.
  [www/adv_dhcpd.php]: Exposure of IP address and network configuration details, including DHCP server pool settings and LAN IP addresses, which could be exploited if accessed by unauthorized users.
  [www/adv_mdhcpd.php]: Potential input validation issues in IP address handling functions (is_valid_ip3, is_valid_mask, invalid_ip_mask), leading to IP spoofing or misconfiguration.
  [www/adv_arpspoofing.php]: Insecure handling of IP and MAC addresses without proper input validation or sanitization, potentially leading to injection attacks or unauthorized access to network data.
  [www/adv_8021q.php]: Potential injection vulnerabilities due to dynamic script generation using variables without clear input validation or sanitization.
  [www/adv_radiusclient.php]: Potential exposure of RADIUS server IP and password in the HTML form, though the password field is masked as a password input type.
  [www/st_log.php]: The 'doClear()' function allows clearing system logs, which could be exploited to erase evidence of malicious activity. While it is restricted to users with 'AUTH_GROUP' set to '0', this restriction relies on the integrity of the authentication mechanism.

- Major Issues: 
  [bin/busybox]: Exposes root credential (USER=root) and version information (v1.14.1, 1.14.1, 9.9) which could be exploited if used insecurely.
