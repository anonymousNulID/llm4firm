- [Location] bin/busybox
- [Type] Vulnerability
- [Version Info] Unknown
- [Description] Two high-risk functions identified: fcn.004120cc and fcn.00427b4c. Both involve the use of the 'system' function with dynamic input, exposing potential command injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, fcn.00427b4c processes environment variables without sufficient validation.
- [Details] The 'system' function is called with dynamic input in both functions, and there is no evidence of proper input sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to remote code execution or privilege escalation. The use of environment variables in fcn.00427b4c without validation exacerbates the risk.
